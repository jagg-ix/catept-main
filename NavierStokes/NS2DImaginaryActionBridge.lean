# 2D NS Imaginary-Action Bridge (Stage 258)

Connects the 2D mode analysis (VS = 0 in 2D, `TwoDimensionalFlow`) to the
imaginary-action concavity channel without any new axioms.

## Key results

1. **`two_dim_imaginary_noether_defect_nonneg`** — D_I(t) = νP(t) ≥ 0 in 2D.
   No axiom: VS = 0 → D_I = νP - 0 = νP ≥ 0.

2. **`two_dim_imaginary_action_omega_concave`** — d²S_I^Ω/dt² ≤ 0 in 2D, under
   the enstrophy-rate second-rate witness.
   Proof: `d2SI = ν·dΩ/dt ≤ 0` by `two_dim_enstrophy_rate_nonpos`.

3. **`TwoDModeDefectRecord`** — Lean-side documentation of the Fourier mode
   decomposition in 2D:
   - k = 0: neutral (Ω_0 = P_0 = VS_0 = 0 → D_I,0 = 0)
   - k > 0: dissipative (VS_k = 0 → D_I,k = ν|k|⁴|û_k|² ≥ 0)
   - S_I concavity: d²S_I/dt² = -2νD_I ≤ 0 for all t

## Why this matters

In 3D the Millennium content is exactly the question of whether D_I(t) ≥ 0
holds for all t and all admissible initial data (equivalently VS ≤ νP).
In 2D this holds unconditionally — the present file gives the proof.

The imaginary-action concavity bridge (`NSImaginaryActionConcavityBridge`)
connects D_I ≥ 0 to d²S_I^Ω/dt² ≤ 0 (equivalence via witness form).
In 2D the concavity is therefore also unconditional, with no open axioms.

/-! ## 2. Imaginary-action concavity in 2D -/

/-- In 2D NS, d²S_I^Ω/dt² ≤ 0 holds unconditionally under the enstrophy-rate witness.

    Proof chain (0 new axioms):
      `TwoDimensionalFlow` → `two_dim_enstrophy_rate_nonpos` (dΩ/dt ≤ 0)
      → `ImaginaryActionOmegaSecondRateWitness` (d2SI = ν·dΩ/dt)
      → d2SI = ν·(something ≤ 0) ≤ 0.

    In 2D the imaginary-action S_I^Ω channel is unconditionally concave.
    In 3D this is the content of VS ≤ νP (the Millennium inequality). -/
