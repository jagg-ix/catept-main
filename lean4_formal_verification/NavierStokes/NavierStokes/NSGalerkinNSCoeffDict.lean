# Stage 209A — NSGalerkinNSCoeffDict: Coefficient-to-NSField Dictionary

Factors the Stage 207/208 single axiom `trajOfWeak_is_NS` into two explicit,
separated obligations:

1. **`SatisfiesNSPDECoeff`** — a coefficient-level NS dynamics predicate asserting
   that the limit sequence has consecutive step differences bounded by `C · h`.
   This is strictly stronger than the Stage 174C `weak_eqn` bound (which gives `≤ 4·E₀`
   independently of `h`); it captures that the Galerkin limit is an O(h)-accurate
   ODE approximation, not merely a bounded sequence.

2. **`NSCoeffDict`** — a dictionary structure bundling:
   * `vel  : CoeffInftyR → NSField` — velocity interpretation map
   * `pres : CoeffInftyR → NSField` — pressure interpretation map
   * `bridge` — the PDE bridge: given coefficient NS dynamics, the piecewise-constant
     trajectory built from `vel ∘ u ∘ ti` and `pres ∘ u ∘ ti` satisfies
     `SatisfiesNSPDE nsOps nsNu` and `RespectsFunctionSpaces nsSpacesR3`.

## Why this factoring matters

The `bridge` field is the *precise* remaining semantic gap between:
* the concrete Galerkin coefficient limit `u : Nat → CoeffInftyR`, and
* the abstract `nsOps`-NS equation and `nsSpacesR3` function-space predicate.

By making `bridge` take `SatisfiesNSPDECoeff u nsNu h` as a *hypothesis*, the
dictionary becomes conditionally useful: Stage 210 can discharge it by concretizing
`NSField := CoeffInftyR` and making `vel := id`, `pres := id`, at which point
`bridge` becomes a theorem from `SatisfiesNSPDECoeff` alone.

## Stage 210 path

Set `NSFieldConcrete := CoeffInftyR`.  Then:
* `vel := id` and `pres := id` are definitional.
* `bridge` reduces to "if the step-difference bound holds with rate C·h, then
  the coefficient sequence satisfies the nsOps NS equation," which is provable
  from the Fourier identification lemmas (once `nsOps` is concretized).

/-! ## Coefficient-level NS dynamics predicate -/

/-- **Coefficient NS dynamics**: a limit sequence `u : Nat → CoeffInftyR` satisfies
    the Galerkin NS dynamics with viscosity `nu` and step size `h` if there exists a
    uniform constant `C > 0` such that consecutive step differences satisfy

    `‖u(k+1) − u(k)‖²_{M} ≤ C · h`  for all `k, M`.

    This is **strictly stronger** than `GalerkinWeakSolution.weak_eqn` (which bounds
    by `4 · E₀`, independent of `h`): it asserts the sequence approximates a genuine
    ODE trajectory with O(h) accuracy per step.

    Mathematical content: Temam (1984) Ch. III §3 — the Galerkin subsequence limit
    satisfies the projected NS ODE in the distributional/weak sense, which implies that
    step differences are O(h) (the discrete ODE residual vanishes with step size).

    Epistemic: `.partiallyVerified` (Temam 1984 Ch. III; compactness + subsequence
    convergence; the limit point of a Galerkin trajectory has ODE-accurate steps). -/

  ∃ C : Real, 0 < C ∧
    ∀ k M : Nat,
      coeffNormSqRRange M (fun m => u (k + 1) m - u k m) ≤ C * (h : Real)

/-! ## Coefficient → NSField dictionary -/

/-- **Coefficient-to-NSField dictionary**: bundles the Fourier interpretation maps
    `vel` and `pres` with the semantic bridge from coefficient NS dynamics to abstract
    NS PDE satisfaction.

    Fields:
    * `vel`    — `CoeffInftyR → NSField` velocity interpretation.
    * `pres`   — `CoeffInftyR → NSField` pressure interpretation.
    * `bridge` — given `u : Nat → CoeffInftyR` satisfying `SatisfiesNSPDECoeff u nsNu h`
                 and any time-index map `ti : Rat → Nat`, the trajectory
                 `⟨fun t => {velocity := vel (u (ti t)), pressure := pres (u (ti t))}⟩`
                 satisfies `SatisfiesNSPDE nsOps nsNu` and `RespectsFunctionSpaces nsSpacesR3`.

    This structure is a **definition** (no axioms here).  The canonical instance
    `canon_ns_dict : NSCoeffDict` is the single axiom introduced in Stage 209B
    (`NSGalerkinWeakToNSBridge`). -/
structure NSCoeffDict where
  /-- Velocity interpretation: Galerkin coefficient vector → NSField velocity value -/
  vel  : CoeffInftyR → NSField
  /-- Pressure interpretation: Galerkin coefficient vector → NSField pressure value -/
  pres : CoeffInftyR → NSField
  /-- **PDE bridge** — the irreducible Fourier-to-nsOps semantic gap.

      States: if `u` satisfies `SatisfiesNSPDECoeff u nsNu h` and `ti : Rat → Nat`
      is any time-index map, then the piecewise-constant trajectory
      `⟨fun t => {velocity := vel (u (ti t)), pressure := pres (u (ti t))}⟩`
      satisfies both `SatisfiesNSPDE nsOps nsNu` and `RespectsFunctionSpaces nsSpacesR3`.

      The hypothesis `SatisfiesNSPDECoeff u nsNu h` isolates the *dynamics* (the
      coefficient sequence approximates the NS ODE with O(h) residuals).  This field
      asserts the *semantic identification*: the dynamics in coefficient space, when
      interpreted via `vel`/`pres`, match the abstract `nsOps` NS equation.

      Epistemic: `.partiallyVerified` (Temam 1984 Ch. III Thm 3.1; the Fourier
      interpretation of the Galerkin ODE residual identifies with the `nsOps`-NS
      equation once `NSField` is concretized as a Fourier function space). -/
